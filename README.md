# Real-time drone system

### Overview
A tello drone system developed using python, the system will allow the drone to do basic movement (up, down, left, right, forward, backword), it also allows rotation with a built-in obstical evader using the proximity sensors inside the drone. 
The drone will stream to your device and recognize and defrinciate between colours as well as take photos or videos.
There is also a simple GUI to explain the functionalities.
Cool trick it can also to front and back flips. Do with that what you may.

All of this is done in real-time as part of my university assignment.
